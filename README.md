# Setup

## Requirements
1. NodeJS 12.x LTS (**download and install it first before trying to run this code**)
2. A server instance, be it Windows or Linux
3. Some knowledge about programming, fair amount of patience and Git-fu


## Installation

### Git Clone Method (recommended)
1. Clone this repository via the clone URL provided. On Windows and Mac you can use Git GUI or SourceTree. On Linux, just make sure you have git installed, then use the Terminal to get that freshly baked source code.
2. Follow the instructions outlined in the **Operating & Updating** header below.

### ZIP Installation Method
1. Obtain a ZIP archive of this repository via the "Download as ZIP" option.
2. Extract it somewhere on your system.

**Note: The ZIP Installation Method loses it's Git metadata, so you will not be able to have easy updates.**

## Updating NodeListServer
1. Stop NodeListServer if it's running.
2. Execute `git pull` from the repository you cloned to your local machine or server instance. Note that if you obtained the source via a ZIP archive, then you're not going to be able to just execute `git pull`. Download and extract a new ZIP archive of this repository instead.
3. Any new updates will be applied automatically, unless you have edited the code in which a merge conflict may occur. You will need to rectify this manually (and you should know how to do this).
4. Start NodeListServer again.
